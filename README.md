# Homework Module 1
## 1.Overview of Project
Help Louise how the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
I followed the module step by step to guide in the development of the excel workbook and how I should be viewing the data. The countifs and years formula was most challenging. I had to google it to get extrenal help. Also, the module initally lists 4 outcomes: successful, failed, canceled, and live. However, in most examples live isn't illustrated. I'm not sure where the disconnect is. Did I make a mistake?

## 3.Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? The month of May has the highest success rates and the lowest faiiled. Additionally, October has the highest failed rates. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Plays greater than 1000 but less than 4999 have the highest percentage of success at 73%. No plays were canceled. 

What are some limitations of this dataset? Is the limitation the data we don't have?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Would be interesting to see Theater Outcomes by Launch Date among different subcategories. Also, placing the "outcomes" in the filters box in the pivot table may highlight other trends.
