# Homework Module 1
## 1.Overview of Project
Help Louise how the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
I followed the module step by step to guide in the development of the excel workbook and how I should be viewing the data. The countifs and years formula was most challenging. I had to google it to get extrenal help. Also, the module initally lists 4 outcomes: successful, failed, canceled, and live. However, in most examples live isn't illustrated. I'm not sure where the disconnect is. Did I make a mistake?

## 3.Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

What are some limitations of this dataset?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
